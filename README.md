# Static page for electify.eu: Informed Choices for the European Elections 2024

## Current Status
The European elections 2024 are over, and we have transformed our app into a static page and taken the app down. Although the interactive features are no longer available, you can still explore our project and its outcomes.

## Interactive App Summarises Parties' Positions
We developed a Streamlit app where voters could ask their questions and receive a summary of the parties' positions. Our mission was to enhance the democratic process by developing an innovative application that used AI. Users could ask a question or enter a keyword in our europarl.ai interface, and our model would summarize the positions of the parties based on the input.

In the background, we used a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) engine that had access to thousands of political documents. Our algorithm searched for the documents most relevant to the user's input. With this information, an AI language model then generated concise summaries for the six biggest parties in Germany.
