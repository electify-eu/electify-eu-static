## Problem: Voters Are Overwhelmed
The challenge facing voters is significant. Elections for the European Parliament are held only every five years, and the European Union (EU), with its intricate structures and processes, often feels distant and complex to the average citizen. This perceived remoteness can lead to the misconception that the EU plays a minor role in the daily lives of its people. However, this is far from the truth. Many decisions that directly impact the lives of EU citizens are made at the European level and then implemented as national law across member states.

## Solution: Interactive App Summarises Parties' Positions
We developed a Streamlit app where voters could ask their questions and receive a summary of the parties' positions. Our mission was to enhance the democratic process by developing an innovative application that used AI. Users could ask a question or enter a keyword in our europarl.ai interface, and our model would summarize the positions of the parties based on the input.

In the background, we used a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) engine that had access to thousands of political documents. Our algorithm searched for the documents most relevant to the user's input. With this information, an AI language model then generated concise summaries for the six biggest parties in Germany.
